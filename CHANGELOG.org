* Changelog

** 0.1 (under development)

- Users can make use of the =writer-jump= function in order to create an outline
  of the current document.
- There is a note section available. This can be disabled by setting the
  =writer-notes-hidden= customizable variable. Otherwise, this section can be
  toggled between shown/hidden by calling the =writer-notes-toggle= (or directly
  using the =writer-notes-hide= and =writer-notes-show= functions).
- This mode will be automatically enabled if the given org-mode document
  has =writer-mode:t= in the =#+PROPERTY= section.
- [[https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti][olivetti]] is an optional dependency, which is going to be enabled automatically
  by this mode if available.
- [[https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode][writeroom-mode]] is an optional dependency, which is going to be picked up by
  functions such as =writer-room= and =writer-room-quit= if available.
